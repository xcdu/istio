Follow this guide to verify that your multicluster Istio installation is working
properly.
Before proceeding, be sure to complete the steps under

 as well as
choosing and following one of the multicluster installation guides.
In this guide, we will deploy the 
 application 
 to 

and 
 to 
. Upon receiving a request, 
 will include
its version in its response.
We will also deploy the 
 container to both clusters. We will use these
pods as the source of requests to the 
 service,
simulating in-mesh traffic. Finally, after generating traffic, we will observe
which cluster received the requests.
In order to make the 
 service callable from any cluster, the DNS
lookup must succeed in each cluster (see


for details). We will address this by deploying the 
 Service to
each cluster in the mesh.
To begin, create the 
 namespace in each cluster:
Enable automatic sidecar injection for the 
 namespace:
Create the 
 service in both clusters:
Deploy the 
 application to 
:
Confirm the 
 pod status:
Wait until the status of 
 is 
.
Deploy the 
 application to 
:
Confirm the status the 
 pod status:
Wait until the status of 
 is 
.
Deploy the 
 application to both clusters:
Confirm the status 
 pod on 
:
Wait until the status of the 
 pod is 
.
Confirm the status of the 
 pod on 
:
Wait until the status of the 
 pod is 
.
To verify that cross-cluster load balancing works as expected, call the

 service several times using the 
 pod. To ensure load
balancing is working properly, call the 
 service from all
clusters in your deployment.
Send one request from the 
 pod on 
 to the 
 service:
Repeat this request several times and verify that the 
 version
should toggle between 
 and 
:
Now repeat this process from the 
 pod on 
:
Repeat this request several times and verify that the 
 version
should toggle between 
 and 
:
 You successfully installed and verified Istio on multiple
clusters!
Initial steps before installing Istio on multiple clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across multiple primary clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across multiple primary clusters on different networks.
Install an Istio mesh across primary and remote clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across primary and remote clusters on different networks.
Workload Local DNS resolution to simplify VM integration, multicluster, and more.
