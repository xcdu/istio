Follow this guide to install the Istio control plane on 
 (the

) and configure 
 (the

) to use the control plane in

. Cluster 
 is on the 
 network, while 

is on the 
 network. This means there is no direct connectivity
between pods across cluster boundaries.
Before proceeding, be sure to complete the steps under

.
In this configuration, cluster 
 will observe the API Servers in
both clusters for endpoints. In this way, the control plane will be able to
provide service discovery for workloads in both clusters.
Service workloads across cluster boundaries communicate indirectly, via
dedicated gateways for 

traffic. The gateway in each cluster must be reachable from the other cluster.
Services in 
 will reach the control plane in 
 via the
same east-west gateway.
Today, the remote profile will install an istiod server in the remote
cluster which will be used for CA and webhook injection for workloads
in that cluster. Service discovery, however, will be directed to the
control plane in the primary cluster.
Future releases will remove the need for having an istiod in the
remote cluster altogether. Stay tuned!
If the istio-system namespace is already created, we need to set the cluster’s network there:
Create the Istio configuration for 
:
Apply the configuration to 
:
Install a gateway in 
 that is dedicated to east-west traffic. By
default, this gateway will be public on the Internet. Production systems may
require additional access restrictions (e.g. via firewall rules) to prevent
external attacks. Check with your cloud vendor to see what options are
available.
Wait for the east-west gateway to be assigned an external IP address:
Before we can install on 
, we need to first expose the control plane in

 so that services in 
 will be able to access service discovery:
Since the clusters are on separate networks, we also need to expose all user
services (*.local) on the east-west gateway in both clusters. While this
gateway is public on the Internet, services behind it can only be accessed by
services with a trusted mTLS certificate and workload ID, just as if they were
on the same network.
If the istio-system namespace is already created, we need to set the cluster’s network there:
Before we can configure the remote cluster, we first have to give the control
plane in 
 access to the API Server in 
. This will do the
following:
Enables the control plane to authenticate connection requests from
workloads running in 
. Without API Server access, the control
plane will reject the requests.
Enables discovery of service endpoints running in 
.
To provide API Server access to 
, we generate a remote secret and
apply it to 
:
Save the address of 
’s east-west gateway.
Now create a remote configuration on 
.
Apply the configuration to 
:
As we did with 
 above, install a gateway in 
 that is dedicated
to east-west traffic and expose user services.
Wait for the east-west gateway to be assigned an external IP address:
As we did with 
 above, expose services via the east-west gateway.
 You successfully installed an Istio mesh across primary
and remote clusters on different networks!
You can now

Initial steps before installing Istio on multiple clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across multiple primary clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across multiple primary clusters on different networks.
Install an Istio mesh across primary and remote clusters.
Verify that Istio has been installed properly on multiple clusters.
Workload Local DNS resolution to simplify VM integration, multicluster, and more.
