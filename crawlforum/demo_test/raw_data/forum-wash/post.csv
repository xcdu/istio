1,Configuring CORS , Security,If you use istio 1.6+ you might need to change  allowOrigin  to  allowOrigins with exact  as mentioned  https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/23757#issuecomment-634699992 .,,If you use istio 1.6+ you might need to change  allowOrigin  to  allowOrigins with exact  as mentioned  https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/23757#issuecomment-634699992 .
2,Configuring CORS , Security,"Thank you  /u/jt97  for this link. Making such change indeed changed the Istio-proxy config when I check it with  istioctl proxy-config . It’s a shame this change is not documented.

I still don’t see any of the  access-control-*  headers.

5,Configuring CORS , Security,"I finally figured it out.  Two things you need to pay attention: You need to add the allowed origins in the allowOrigins field. You need to specify the “Origin” header in the curl command to indicate that it’s a cors request. Otherwise, the access-control-allow-* headers won’t show up.
