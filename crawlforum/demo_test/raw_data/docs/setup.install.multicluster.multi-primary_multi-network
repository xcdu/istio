Follow this guide to install the Istio control plane on both 
 and

, making each a 
. Cluster

 is on the 
 network, while 
 is on the

 network. This means there is no direct connectivity between pods
across cluster boundaries.
Before proceeding, be sure to complete the steps under

.
In this configuration, both 
 and 
 observe the API Servers
in each cluster for endpoints.
Service workloads across cluster boundaries communicate indirectly, via
dedicated gateways for 

traffic. The gateway in each cluster must be reachable from the other cluster.
If the istio-system namespace is already created, we need to set the cluster’s network there:
Create the Istio configuration for 
:
Apply the configuration to 
:
Install a gateway in 
 that is dedicated to

 traffic. By
default, this gateway will be public on the Internet. Production systems may
require additional access restrictions (e.g. via firewall rules) to prevent
external attacks. Check with your cloud vendor to see what options are
available.
Wait for the east-west gateway to be assigned an external IP address:
Since the clusters are on separate networks, we need to expose all services
(*.local) on the east-west gateway in both clusters. While this gateway is
public on the Internet, services behind it can only be accessed by services
with a trusted mTLS certificate and workload ID, just as if they were on the
same network.
If the istio-system namespace is already created, we need to set the cluster’s network there:
Create the Istio configuration for 
:
Apply the configuration to 
:
As we did with 
 above, install a gateway in 
 that is dedicated
to east-west traffic.
Wait for the east-west gateway to be assigned an external IP address:
As we did with 
 above, expose services via the east-west gateway.
Install a remote secret in 
 that provides access to 
’s API server.
Install a remote secret in 
 that provides access to

 You successfully installed an Istio mesh across multiple

Initial steps before installing Istio on multiple clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across multiple primary clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across primary and remote clusters.
Install an Istio mesh across primary and remote clusters on different networks.
Verify that Istio has been installed properly on multiple clusters.
Workload Local DNS resolution to simplify VM integration, multicluster, and more.
