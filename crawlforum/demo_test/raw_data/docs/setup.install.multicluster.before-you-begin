Before you begin a multicluster installation, review the


which describes the foundational concepts used throughout this guide.
In addition, review the requirements and perform the initial steps below.
This guide requires that you have two Kubernetes clusters with any of the
supported Kubernetes versions: 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19.
The API Server in each cluster must be accessible to the other clusters in the
mesh. Many cloud providers make API Servers publicly accessible via network
load balancers (NLB). If the API Server is not directly accessible, you will
have to modify the installation procedure to enable access. For example, the

 gateway used in
the multi-network and primary-remote configurations could also be used
to enable access to the API Server.
This guide will refer to two clusters named 
 and 
. The following
environment variables will be used throughout to simplify the instructions:
For example:
A multicluster service mesh deployment requires that you establish trust
between all clusters in the mesh. Depending on the requirements for your
system, there may be multiple options available for establishing trust.
See 
 for
detailed descriptions and instructions for all available options.
Depending on which option you choose, the installation instructions for
Istio may change slightly.
This guide will assume that you use a common root to generate intermediate
certificates for each cluster. Follow the 

to generate and push a CA certificate secret to both the 
 and 

clusters.
You’re now ready to install an Istio mesh across multiple clusters. The
particular steps will depend on your requirements for network and
control plane topology.
Choose the installation that best fits your needs:
For meshes that span more than two clusters, you may need to use more than
one of these options. For example, you may have a primary cluster per region
(i.e. multi-primary) where each zone has a remote cluster that uses the
control plane in the regional primary (i.e. primary-remote).
