With a single 
 CR, any gateways defined in the CR (including the 
 installed in the
default profile) are upgraded in place, even when the

 is used.
This is undesirable because gateways are a critical component affecting application uptime.
They should be upgraded last, after the new control and data plane versions are verified to be working.
This guide describes the recommended way to upgrade gateways by defining and managing them in a separate 
 CR,
separate from the one used to install and manage the control plane.
This section covers the installation and upgrade of a separate control plane and gateway using 
. The example
demonstrates how to upgrade Istio 1.8.0 to 1.8.1 using canary upgrade, with gateways being managed separately from
the control plane.
Ensure that the main 
 CR has a name and does not install a gateway:
Create a separate 
 CR for the gateway(s), ensuring that it has a name and has the 
 profile:
Install the 
s:
Istioctl install and the operator track resource ownership through labels for both the revision and owning CR name.
Only resources whose name and revision labels match the 
 CR passed to 
 install/operator will be
affected by any changes to the CR - all other resources in the cluster will be ignored.
It is important to make sure that each 
 installs components that do not overlap with another 

CR, otherwise the two CR’s will cause controllers or 
 commands to interfere with each other.
Let’s assume that the target version is 1.8.1.
Download the Istio 1.8.1 release and use the 
 from that release to install the Istio 1.8.1 control plane:
(Refer to the canary upgrade docs for more details on steps 2-4.)
Verify that the control plane is functional.
Label workload namespaces with istio.io/rev=1-8-1 and restart the workloads.
Verify that the workloads are injected with the new proxy version and the cluster is functional.
At this point, the ingress gateway is still 1.8.0. You should see the following pods running:
As a last step, upgrade any gateways in the cluster to the new version:
Delete the 1.8.1 version of the control plane:
This section covers the installation and upgrade of a separate control plane and gateway using the Istio operator.
The example demonstrates how to upgrade Istio 1.8.0 to 1.8.1 using canary upgrade, with gateways being managed separately
from the control plane.
Ensure that the main 
 CR has a name and revision, and does not install a gateway:
Create a separate 
 CR for the gateway(s), ensuring that it has a name and has the 
 profile:
Apply the files to the cluster with the following commands:
Install the Istio operator into the cluster:
Verify that the operator and Istio control plane are installed and running.
Let’s assume that the target version is 1.8.1.
Download the Istio 1.8.1 release and use the 
 from that release to install the Istio 1.8.1 operator:
Copy the control plane CR from the install step above as 
. Change all instances of

 to 
 in the files.
Apply the new file to the cluster:
Verify that two versions of 
 are running in the cluster. It may take several minutes for the operator to
install the new control plane and for it to be in a running state.
Refer to the canary upgrade docs for more details on rolling over workloads to the new Istio version:
Upgrade the gateway to the new revision. Edit the 
 file from the installation step to change the
revision from 
 to 
 and re-apply the file:
Perform a rolling restart of the gateway deployment:
Verify that the gateway is running at version 1.8.1.
Uninstall the old control plane:
Upgrade Istio by first running a canary deployment of a new control plane.
Upgrade or downgrade Istio in place.
Deploy multiple Istio egress gateways independently to have fine-grained control of egress communication from the mesh.
Automating Istio configuration for Istio deployments (clusters) that work as a single mesh.
Provision and manage DNS certificates in Istio.
