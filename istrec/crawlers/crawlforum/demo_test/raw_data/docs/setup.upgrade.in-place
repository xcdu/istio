The 
 command performs an upgrade of Istio. Before performing
the upgrade, it checks that the Istio installation meets the upgrade eligibility
criteria. Also, it alerts the user if it detects any changes in the profile
default values between Istio versions.
The upgrade command can also perform a downgrade of Istio.
See the 

for all the options provided by the 
 command.
Before you begin the upgrade process, check the following prerequisites:
The installed Istio version is no more than one minor version less than the upgrade version.
For example, 1.6.0 or higher is required before you start the upgrade process to 1.7.x.
Your Istio installation was

and change directory to the new release directory.
Ensure that your Kubernetes configuration points to the cluster to upgrade:
Begin the upgrade by running this command:
If you installed Istio using 
 flags, ensure that you pass the same 
 flags to upgrade,
otherwise the customizations done with

configuration file instead of

 will in-place upgrade the Istio control plane and gateways to the new version and indicate the
completion status.
After 
 completes the upgrade, you must manually update the Istio data plane
by restarting any pods with Istio sidecars:
Before you begin the downgrade process, check the following prerequisites:
Your Istio installation was 
.
The Istio version you intend to downgrade to is no more than one minor version less than the installed Istio version.
For example, you can downgrade to no lower than 1.6.0 from Istio 1.7.x.
Downgrade must be done using the 
 binary version that
corresponds to the Istio version that you intend to downgrade to.
For example, if you are downgrading from Istio 1.7 to 1.6.5, use 

version 1.6.5.
You can use 
 to downgrade to a lower version of Istio. The steps are
identical to the upgrade process described in the previous section, only using the 
 binary corresponding
to the lower version (e.g., 1.6.5). When completed, Istio will be restored to the previously installed version.
Alternatively, 
 can be used to install an older version of the Istio control plane, but is not recommended
because it does not perform any checks. For example, default values applied to the cluster for a configuration
profile may change without warning.
